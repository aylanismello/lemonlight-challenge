This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The Design Process.
This simple layout was designed on Figma, with a live link [here](https://www.figma.com/file/6GpbXYVYDcG0V0woxDyhyi/Lemonlight-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1)

## Notes:
I didn't take the time to make the site responsive or use a CSS preprocessor, or do anything besides the core basics since that's how I understood the directions to be. Enjoy!
